# Lease payments

Lease payments is a React front-end for viewing the payment details for any given lease id on the :Different test (backend) server. This has been done as a code test application for :Different and has no other purpose at this point.

## About

“Different” offers a web-based app to the tenants to manage their lease. Due to the
high demand, the product owner decided to release a new feature that allows tenants
to see a list of their past and upcoming rent payments. This is how this feature has been implemented by me.
